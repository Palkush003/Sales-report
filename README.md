# Sales Dashboard Project

## Introduction

This project showcases a Sales Dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of sales data across three main views: Overall Sales, Region and State, and Category and Sub-Category. The objective of the dashboard is to offer insights into sales performance, trends, and patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

## Overall Sales

The Overall Sales view includes KPIs that highlight key metrics such as Total Revenue, Profit, and Quantity. It uses a combination of Line and Stacked Column charts to visualize Sales and Profit by Year, demonstrating the sales growth from 2011 to 2014.

- **Sales by Segment**: The dashboard displays the sales performance across different segments: Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office. Corporate leads in sales after Consumer.

- **Profit and Sales by Category**: The data shows that Technology is the leading category in sales from 2011 to 2014, followed by Office Supplies and Furniture.

- **Quarterly Analysis**: The dashboard presents quarterly sales data, highlighting that the fourth quarter consistently performs the best.

## Region and State Analysis

The Region and State view analyzes sales data at regional and state levels. It identifies the top-performing states in terms of sales and profit, as well as the regions with high and low levels of sales in various sub-categories.

- **City-wise Analysis**: The table provides an overview of Quantity and Profit by city.

- **Sales by State**: England stands out as the state with the highest sales across all categories.

- **Sub-Category Analysis**: Line and Clustered Column charts visualize sales across sub-categories such as Accessories, Appliances, Art, Binders, Bookcases, Chairs, Copiers, Envelopes, Phones, Storage, Machines, and more.

- **Slicers**: Utilize slicers to analyze sales data for specific regions, states, and years.

## Category and Sub-Category Analysis

The Category and Sub-Category view offers a comprehensive look at sales data related to different categories and sub-categories. Analyzing sales by these groupings provides valuable insights into profits, challenges, and opportunities.
